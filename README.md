The **International Journal of Basic Sciences and Applied Computing (IJBSAC)** has ISSN: 2394-367X (online), which is an online, open access, peer reviewed, periodical monthly international journal. This journal is published by Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication (BEIESP) in the months of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December.

The aim of the journal is to publish high quality peer–reviewed original articles in the area of Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology and Pharmacy that covers Physics: Classical Mechanics, Electro Techniques, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, Chemistry: Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Bio Chemistry, Mathematics: Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Combinatorics, Differential Equations, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Abstract Algebra (includes group theory, ring theory, field theory, and module theory), Topology, Number Theory, Logic, Probability, Statistics, Game Theory, Functional Analysis, Algebraic Geometry, Differential Geometry, Dynamical Systems (includes “chaos theory”), Numerical Analysis, Set Theory, Category Theory, Model Theory, Biology: Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Bioinformatics, Cell Biology, Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Neurobiology, Cytology, Pathology, Immunobiology, Botany: Biogeography, Biotechnology, Cell Biology, Conservation Biology, Ecology, Ecophysiology, Environmental Science and Management, Evolutionary Biology, Flowering time and plant responses to abiotic stress, Fossils, Freshwater Botany, Fungal diseases of tropical and temperate plants, Marine Botany, Molecular plant biology, Plant Biodiversity, Plant Cell Biology, Plant Development, Plant Diseases, Plant Ecology, Plant Hormones, Plant Physiology, Plant Reproduction, Plant Systematics, Plant Virology, Population genetics, Pharmacy: Pharmaceutical Technology, Pharmaceutics, Novel Drug Delivery, Biopharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacognosy and Natural Product Research, Pharmaceutical/Medicinal Chemistry, Computational Chemistry and Molecular Drug Design, Pharmaceutical Analysis, Pharmacology, Pharmacy Practice, Clinical and Hospital Pharmacy, Cell Biology, Genomics and Proteomics, Pharmacogenomics, Bioinformatics, Pharmacoeconomics, Research outcomes from medical sciences/case study and biotechnology of pharmaceutical interest are also considered.
Author (s) can submit articles electronically round the year. The Editors reserve the right to reject articles without sending them out for review. Submitted articles should not have been previously published or be currently under consideration for publication elsewhere. Briefs and research notes are not published in this journal. Submitted articles must be within the scope of the journal. All articles go through a double-blind peer review process. 

After the final acceptance of the article, based upon the detailed review process and submission of required documents, the article will be published online immediately. However, the assignment of the article of specific issue (see archive) will be taken up by the editors later; and the authors will be intimated accordingly. For theme based special issues, time bound special calls for articles will be announced.
